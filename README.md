Notes:
The studies are conducted using R and Matlab. Please make sure Rstudio and Matlab are installed. R is used as it provides nice and easy-to-use splinefit package. Optimization problems and estimations are conducted using Matlab.  

Steps:
1. Download the files in the repository to a local folder called "Github".

2. Create a subfolder in "Github" called "boot_samples". The folder "boot_samples" will be used to store bootstrapped samples. Copy and paste the mfile "importcsv.m" to the folder "boot_samples".

3. Now we are ready to play with the data! Run the first section of Rcodes.R.
